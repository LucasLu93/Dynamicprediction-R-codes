# R codes for generating dynamic predictions of colorectal cancer risk and polyp counts for individuals with Lynch Syndrome based on the trivariate joint model for longitudinal count data, recurrent events, and a terminal event

Dynamic predictions for terminal event risk - Model 1 and Model 2.R: This R script includes the generation code for dynamic predictions of terminal event risk for individuals at prediction time t = 0 year, based on Model 1: the proposed trivaraite joint model with both familial correlations and family history and Model 2: alternative trivariate joint model without familial correlations.

Dynamic predictions for terminal event risk - Model 3.R: This R script includes the generation code for dynamic predictions of terminal event risk for individuals at prediction time t = 0 year, based on Model 3: alternative trivariate joint model without family history.

Dynamic predictions for longitudinal outcomes - Model 1 and Model 2.R: This R script includes the generation code for dynamic predictions of longitudinal outcomes for individuals at prediction time t = 0 year, based on Model 1: the proposed trivaraite joint model with both familial correlations and family history and Model 2: alternative trivariate joint model without familial correlations.

Dynamic predictions for longitudinal outcomes - Model 3.R: This R script includes the generation code for dynamic predictions of longitudinal outcomes for individuals at prediction time t = 0 year, based on Model 3: alternative trivariate joint model without family history.
